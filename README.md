# Amber Alert System using Random Forest Algorithm

## Introduction

Proof of concept application that was created as the semester project for the Bsc.CSIT 7th semester.
This project is an attempt to create a missing persons alert system. Since the project was inspired by the existing amber alert system we decided to keep the project name same.
